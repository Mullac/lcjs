ToDo on current task:
	- Get Karma running manually with one browser
	- multiple browsers
	- automate
	- check that we're testing against all supported browsers
	- Move karma conf file to another location
	- Unify our test file location configuration (it's currently split between Jakefile & karma.conf.js)

Future ideas:
	- Create 'fail fast' assertion code
	- Abstract test framework? (Swap out frameworks to ensure that abstraction works)
	- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
	- Handle errors properly in server.js
	- server.stop() waits for open connections to close (e.g. Firefox keeps an open connection).
	  Make if forcibly close?
	- Remove Node version duplication between package.json and jakefile.js

Notes:
	- Nodeunit default reporter has minor display issues on Windows
